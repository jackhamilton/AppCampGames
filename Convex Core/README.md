# Galaga
An iPhone based Galaga-like game.

The original version of this app was created as a demo for Asheville School's App Camp 2016, and the 2017 version is  a cleaner version with a full creation tutorial as a student project for Asheville School App Camp 2017. The framework will then be extended into a Danmaku-genre iPhone game based on the Touhou series of bullet hell shooters.
