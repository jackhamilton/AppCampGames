# App Camp Games (2016-2021)

This repository contains all of the games I wrote as part of Asheville School's App Camp and Swift App School (the project name after it became independent). The code style is geared towards minimizing complexity of instruction - I've avoided things like complicated data structure types and tried to simplify optional usage. I've also cut down the volume of code and generally tried to simplify everything as much as possible. I got a lot better at it over the years.

The two most complex are probably ConvexCore and TileTerminator. I've tried various different types of games over the years as I've learned, and probably won't do anything quite so complex as those again since some students had trouble following along.

It also includes my book. This covers the first two years of games, and is entirely self-written. We stopped doing books after 2018 for a variety of reasons - it's a ton of extra work, and also some students were using it as a crutch by copying code and not reading the explanations. I thought it was better to teach everything live to everyone at the same time rather than splitting attention between two modes of instruction. Nevertheless, I'm pretty proud of the book.
